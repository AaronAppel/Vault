Improve testing api:
- List test suite names in menu. Maybe create a base TestCase class to subclass from

+ Write results to a file for quick comparisons between Mem and new, but also from last runs
    Maybe use an excel spreadsheet for data management. This could make runtime value changing simple

+ Create a logger class for controlling output
    This could help formatting output for comparing results

+ Move Source folder up a directory
