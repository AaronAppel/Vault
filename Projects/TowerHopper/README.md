# TowerHopper
My solution to the popular "Tower Hopper" programming problem.

I initially found the problem while studying for technical job interviews.
This is the video that explained it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHWy5nEfRIQ

My goal for now is to find a solution for each the 4 methods mentioned in the video, without searching for answers.
The 4 projects I have now are:
-TowerHopper_Graph: SOLVED
Represent the array as a graph and parse connections to find a valid path.

-TowerHopper_Dynamic: INCOMPLETE

-TowerHopper_Recursive INCOMPLETE

-TowerHopper_Simplified INCOMPLETE
